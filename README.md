# Origin Clone Angular

After watching the Demo video, I thought it would be fun to clone one of the pages that were shown. I chose the Goals tab because I like how it looks, and it sounded like a realistic challenge to accomplish in my free time. It took me around 10 hours to create, so there is a lot of rushed code!

I had to imagine a few things, such as the Completed Goals area, the New Account form, the New Goal form, and the Monthly Budget side-drawer.

If you have any tips, questions, or you would like me to build something on top of this, do let me know!

> If there are any problems with branding/NDA for the design, please do let me know and I will make the appropriate changes!

*Hope you enjoy it as much as I did to create it!*

## How to use it!

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Features

- Mobile Friendly;
- Drawers and User Feedback Alers;
- JSON Server for testing HTTP calls;
- Add new Accounts;
- Add new Goals;
- Mark Goals as completed;
- Calculates a bunch of things by itself such as:
  - Monthly Budget to invest;
  - Money assigned to goals;
  - Money left unassigned;
  - Goal progress;
  - ... and more!

## Things I would do before giving this prototype the 'finished' stamp:

- Unit Testing
- e2e Testing
- Dark Mode
- Finish Goals CRUD
- Refactor the forms into Angular Reactive Forms, for better control and validation states.
- Give TailwindCSS a good cleanup

# Origin Clone Angular

After watching the Demo video, I thought it would be fun to clone one of the pages that were shown. I chose the Goals tab because I like how it looks, and it sounded like a realistic challenge to accomplish in my free time. It probably took me around 10 hours to create.

If you have any tips, questions, or you would like me to build something on top of this, do let me know!

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Or visit the [Origin Clone App](https://origin-angular-davurie.vercel.app/) to see it live!

## Features

- Mobile Friendly;
- Drawers and User Feedback Alers;
- JSON Server for testing HTTP calls;
- Add new Accounts;
- Add new Goals;
- Mark Goals as completed;
- Calculates a bunch of things by itself such as:
  - Monthly Budget to invest;
  - Money assigned to goals;
  - Money left unassigned;
  - Goal progress;
  - ... and more!

## Things I would do before giving this prototype the 'finished' stamp:

- Unit Testing
- e2e Testing
- Dark Mode
- Finish Goals CRUD
- Refactor the forms into Angular Reactive Forms, for better control and validation states.
- Give TailwindCSS a good cleanup

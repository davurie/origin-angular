## Features

- Mobile Friendly;
- Drawers and User Feedback Alers;
- JSON Server for testing HTTP calls;
- Add new Accounts;
- Add new Goals;
- Calculates a bunch of things by itself such as:
  - Monthly Budget to invest;
  - Money assigned to goals;
  - Money left unnassigned;
  - Goal progress;
  - ... and more!

## Things I would do before giving this prototype the 'finished' stamp:

- Unit Testing
- e2e Testing
- Dark Mode
- Finish Goals CRUD
- Refactor the forms into Angular Reactive Forms, for better control and validation states.
- Give TailwindCSS a good cleanup
